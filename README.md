# How do I approach designing software?
* This project has taught me the foundations of working in developing a computational 3D scene in OpenGL library. I have learned how adding different shading techniques be it lighting or different textures or material effects, I can acheive (almost) lifelike examples of virtually created objects and scenes. The step or milestone approach was greatly at the focus of creation of this scene as each milestone added a new concept to the scene.

# How do I approach developing programs?
* My approach to developing programs begins with understanding the requirements, breaking the project into smaller tasks, and planning the structure before writing any code. I prioritize implementing core functionality first, testing frequently, and refining as needed. While working on my 3D scene, I experimented with new development strategies such as optimizing performance, improving lighting, and refining object placement to enhance realism. Iteration played a crucial role in my development process, allowing me to test, adjust, and optimize my scene for better performance and visual quality. Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved as I improved my problem-solving skills, adopted better coding practices, and learned to balance efficiency with functionality, ultimately leading to a more polished final product.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
* Computer science plays a crucial role in helping me reach my goals, particularly in my pursuit of a career in cybersecurity and penetration testing. By developing strong problem-solving skills, learning programming languages, and understanding complex systems, I can effectively analyze security vulnerabilities and create solutions to protect digital assets. Computational graphics and visualizations have provided me with new knowledge and skills that can be applied in both my educational and professional pathways. In my education, working with computational graphics has enhanced my understanding of algorithms, data structures, and mathematical concepts, strengthening my overall programming abilities. Professionally, these skills can be valuable in cybersecurity, where visualizing data, analyzing network structures, and understanding system behaviors through graphical representations can aid in identifying threats and improving security measures. The ability to work with computational graphics also enhances my creativity and technical problem-solving, which are essential in cybersecurity and other areas of computer science.
